  <p>Different cultures have developed unique ways to greet each other—some formal, some deeply spiritual, some just plain fun. Handshakes dominate in the West, while bowing is rooted in East Asian tradition. Cheek kisses reign in Latin cultures, and hand-over-heart greetings carry respect across the Middle East.</p>

  <p>From the <strong>Wai</strong> in Thailand to the <strong>Hongi</strong> of the Māori, every greeting tells a story. This map reveals how we say “hello” without ever saying a word.</p>
